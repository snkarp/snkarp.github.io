<h4>Grading</h4>

<p>
The final grade will be based on several homework assignments (75%) and one in-class midterm exam (25%). There will not be a final exam.
</p>

<hr>

<h4>Homework</h4>

<p>
Homework is due by the end of class time on the due date, submitted either in person or to my office (slid under the door). Late homework will not be accepted without prior approval. You are allowed to work with other students, but must include their names and write your solutions independently. You may also consult resources such as textbooks and online notes, which you must cite in your solutions. You are not allowed to copy solutions from other students or elsewhere, or to post or discuss homework problems online (including on websites such as Stack Exchange and MathOverflow). Any student determined to have engaged in academic dishonesty will receive a course penalty and be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education.
</p>

<p>
I may occasionally assign supplementary 'bonus' problems, which are not for credit. Students motivated to complete such problems should submit them to me individually (separately from homework submissions) at any time up to the last day of class.
</p>
<hr>

<h4>Midterm exam</h4>

<p>
The midterm exam will be held in class on Friday, March 9th. The exam will be 'open notes': you may use your personal written or printed notes, but not any books or printouts thereof. The exam covers material up to and including the lecture of 02/12, and the first three homework assignments.
</p>

<h4>Accommodations for students with disabilities</h4>

<p>
The University of Michigan is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Request for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Office located at G664 Haven Hall. The SSD phone number is 734-763-3000. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation (VISA) form. Please present this form to me as soon as possible, and at least two weeks prior to the need for the accommodation.
